Enhances the use of page hierarchies by providing easy access to the parent page, sibling pages, and child pages in your admin area.

== Description ==

Parent pages and hierarchical content strategies are often overlooked when building a WordPress site because it’s too illusive. When setting a parent page, what does it really mean in terms of your site’s overall structure?

Maintaining content organization documentation becomes exhausting and can lose its accuracy as changes are made to your site’s pages. Not to mention the ever-growing list of unorganized Pages!

Grouped Content helps you easily organize your website’s content by unleashing the true potential of WordPress’s hierarchical system for pages. You’ll be able to quickly access related pages and see where each page fits in your site’s hierarchy. Maintaining proper content organization and site structure has never been easier.

Here are some of the ways Grouped Content helps you build a better site structure:

= Access Related Pages =
When a page is assigned a Parent Page, you’ll instantly be able to see and access sibling pages. When that page becomes a Parent Page of another page, you’ll also be able to access all of its child pages. It’s all right there, in your Page Relatives metabox.

= Organized Content =
In the Groups admin page, you can quickly navigate through the page hierarchies you’ve so simply established by assigning Parent Pages. Quickly access everything you need for your pages in an organized hierarchical view so that you can focus on what you came to do.

= Improve Site Experience =
Now that you’re able to automatically see your site’s structure as you establish hierarchies, you’ve improved the content structure for you and your visitors. Hierarchical URLs improve your visitors’ experience with your site by producing more memorable links that let your visitors know where they are.

= Developer Friendly Code =
Grouped Content is built open-source and fully documented so that your developers can quickly build Grouped Content into exactly what you need it to be. To make customization even easier, plenty of hooks are also made available to developers so that changes can be quickly added and easily maintained as new versions of Grouped Content are released.

== Installation ==

Grouped Content does not require any configurations after being activated. If you have already been making use of page hierarchies, Grouped Content will automatically enhance your experience maintaining page structures. Grouped Content makes use of WordPress’s native page hierarchies system rather than cluttering your database with additional data. It is extremely lightweight. Here are the features you should notice upon proper installation and activation:

= The Groups Screen =
After installing and activating Grouped Content on your WordPress website, you’ll see a new admin page in your lefthand menu titled Groups. It should be right below Pages. This is where you’ll be able to instantly see any page hierarchies that you’ve established. If you have not set any Parent Pages, then this will be empty until you do.

= The Page Relatives Metabox =
Another noticeable feature that’s been added to your admin area is the Page Relatives metabox. It is available in the righthand sidebar when editing a Page. If the page currently being edited has been assigned a Parent Page or the page has been assigned as the Parent Page on other pages, the Page Relatives box will display links to the related content where you can readily access them.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I request a feature? =

Absolutely! Feedback and feature requests are strongly encouraged. Please email [hello@purpleturtlecreative.com](mailto:hello@purpleturtlecreative.com). It helps a lot if you describe your problem and how you see Grouped Content solving it.

= Why don’t I see anything in Groups? =

Groups are formed when you assign a Parent Page to a page. When editing a page, you may assign a Parent Page in the Page Attributes section on the righthand side of your edit screen. If you can’t find this box and are using Classic view (non-Gutenberg), it may be hidden. To show the Page Attributes metabox, click Screen Options at the top of the edit screen and then tick the checkbox to show Page Attributes.

= Why can’t I find the Page Relatives metabox? =

If the Page Relatives metabox is not listed on the righthand side when editing a page, be sure to check your Screen Options if you’re using Classic view (non-Gutenberg). Click the Screen Options tab at the top of the page edit screen and then tick the checkbox to show Page Relatives.

= Where can I find documentation for this plugin? =

Tutorials and developer documentation for Grouped Content are currently being prepared on the new Purple Turtle Creative website.
